# Apple Developer Account Organization Requirement

## Issue: Individual Account Used for Business App
Apple requires that apps handling sensitive user data or operating in highly regulated fields (like home services) must be submitted through an **Organization** Apple Developer account, not an **Individual** account.

## Current Problem:
- HomeLinkGH was submitted through an Individual Apple Developer account
- Apple requires Organization account for apps with sensitive user data
- This affects apps that handle:
  - Home services (like HomeLinkGH)
  - Financial services
  - Healthcare services
  - Other regulated industries

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Convert Individual to Organization Account
**Contact Apple Developer Support** to convert your existing account:

1. **Email Apple Developer Support**: developer.apple.com/contact
2. **Request**: Account conversion from Individual to Organization  
3. **Provide**:
   - Business registration documents
   - Tax ID/EIN number
   - Proof of business legitimacy
   - Legal business name

**Timeline**: Usually 2-4 weeks for conversion

### Option 2: Create New Organization Account
**Enroll in new Apple Developer Program** as organization:

1. **Go to**: developer.apple.com/programs/enroll
2. **Select**: "Enroll as an Organization"
3. **Provide**:
   - Business registration
   - D-U-N-S Number (free from Dun & Bradstreet)
   - Legal business documents
   - $99/year fee

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for new account approval

### Option 3: Fee Waiver (If Applicable)
If HomeLinkGH qualifies as:
- **Nonprofit organization**
- **Educational institution** 
- **Government entity**

You can request a fee waiver from Apple.

## Required Documents:
- **Business License/Registration**
- **Tax ID/EIN** 
- **D-U-N-S Number** (for organization enrollment)
- **Legal business name** matching official documents

## Next Steps:
1. **Choose conversion vs. new account** based on your timeline needs
2. **Gather required business documents**
3. **Contact Apple Developer Support** or enroll new account
4. **Transfer HomeLinkGH app** to organization account once approved
5. **Resubmit app** from organization account

## Important Notes:
- **Individual accounts cannot resolve this** with documentation
- **Organization account is mandatory** for this type of app
- **App transfer** between accounts is possible once org account is ready
- **All future updates** must come from organization account

## Timeline Estimate:
- **Account conversion**: 2-4 weeks
- **New organization enrollment**: 1-2 weeks  
- **App transfer**: 1-2 days
- **Resubmission**: Same day

The quickest path is usually creating a new organization account while gathering documents for conversion as backup.
