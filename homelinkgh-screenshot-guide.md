# HomeLinkGH iPad Screenshot Requirements

## Issue: Stretched iPhone Screenshots
Apple rejected because the iPad screenshots show iPhone images that were stretched/modified to appear as iPad images.

## Required iPad Screenshot Sizes:
- **12.9" iPad Pro (6th gen)**: 2048 x 2732 pixels
- **11" iPad Pro (4th gen)**: 1668 x 2388 pixels  
- **iPad (10th gen)**: 1620 x 2160 pixels

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Create Proper iPad Screenshots
You need to either:
- **Option A**: Run the app on actual iPad devices and take screenshots
- **Option B**: Use iPad simulators in Xcode to generate proper screenshots
- **Option C**: Create mockup iPad screenshots showing the app correctly scaled for iPad

### 2. Screenshot Content Should Show:
- **HomeLinkGH app interface** properly scaled for iPad screen size
- **Real app functionality** - not stretched iPhone interface
- **Key features**: Service booking, provider profiles, messaging, etc.
- **iPad-appropriate layout** with proper spacing and sizing

### 3. What NOT to Include:
- Stretched or modified iPhone screenshots
- Marketing materials that don't reflect actual app UI
- Login screens only (show main functionality)

### 4. Upload Process:
1. Log into App Store Connect
2. Go to your HomeLinkGH app
3. Select "App Store" tab
4. Go to "Previews and Screenshots"
5. Click "View All Sizes in Media Manager"
6. Upload proper iPad screenshots for each required size

## Quick Fix Option:
If you can't access iPad devices immediately, you can:
1. Use iPad simulators in Xcode
2. Run your app in iPad Air/Pro simulators
3. Take screenshots directly from simulator
4. Ensure the interface looks natural for iPad (not stretched)

The key is showing the app as it naturally appears on iPad, not a modified iPhone version.
