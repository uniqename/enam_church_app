## üì± Mobile App Files (IPA & AAB)

Due to the Java version compatibility issues with the current Capacitor setup, here are the recommended approaches to create the mobile app files:

### Method 1: Use Android Studio & Xcode (Recommended)

#### For Android (AAB file):
1. **Open Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

2. **In Android Studio**:
   - File ‚Üí Sync Project with Gradle Files
   - Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Choose "Android App Bundle"
   - Create/select keystore file
   - Build the AAB file

3. **Output**: The AAB file will be in `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/`

#### For iOS (IPA file):
1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

2. **In Xcode**:
   - Select "Faith Klinik Ministries" target
   - Product ‚Üí Archive
   - Window ‚Üí Organizer ‚Üí Archives
   - Export for App Store distribution

### Method 2: Fix Java Version Issues

To fix the Java compatibility issues for command-line building:

1. **Install Java 21**:
   ```bash
   brew install openjdk@21
   export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"
   ```

2. **Build Android**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean bundleRelease
   ```

### Method 3: Alternative Build Process

If the above methods don't work, you can use these alternative approaches:

#### Using Cordova (Alternative)
```bash
npm install -g cordova
cordova platform add android ios
cordova build android --release
cordova build ios --release
```

#### Using Ionic Capacitor
```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
ionic capacitor build android --prod
ionic capacitor build ios --prod
```
